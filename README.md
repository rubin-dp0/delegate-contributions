# delegate-contributions

In this short note, we will show how you can contribute your work to the larger DP0 community.  
Here, we will assume that you are working with a notebook - be it one of the DP0 - provided 
notebooks, or an antirely new one.  The key to learning how to contribute is to follow the workflow.  
The recommended way is to edit an existing notebook (or start new ones) in your own instance of Jupyter .  
We recommend doing it in a suitable development branch, which you can subsequently push to the base 
repository, and submit a pull request>  this will enable a code review. All delegates will have Write 
access and so can do this; everyone else can push to their fork of the Delegate repository, and submit  
a pull requestfrom there. To exercise this workflow, try modifying Hello_World.ipynb, pushing your 
commit(s) and submitting a Pull Request.  As a good practice, don't forget to clear outputs and save 
before committing your changes!
