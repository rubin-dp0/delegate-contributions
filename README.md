# delegate-contributions-dp01

This repository is for DP0 delegates to contribute tutorials for DP0.1. 

These tutorials could be Jupyter Notebooks, or markdown-formatted demonstrations of a DP0.1-related analysis with command-line tasks or the Portal Aspect.

Please contribute only tutorials that you have verified to run, and which you agree to maintain and be contacted about.

## How to contribute to this repository.

### Directories

All tutorials must be organized into directories.
An ``example`` directory is provided as an illustration.
Anyone may make a directory for a specific science topic, a specific tool or type of analysis, by DP0.1 working group, etc.
Directory creators must create a README.md file within the folder which identifies them as the directory maintainer and describes the contents of the directory.
Contact the directory creator if you want to contribute content to their directory.
Direct messages between delegates in Community.lsst.org is an appropriate mode of contact.

### Workflow

1. Make a branch for your work, and name it u/(your github username).
2. Add and edit content in your branch until you're ready to share it with everyone.
3. Start a new Pull Request (PR) from your branch to main. Assign another DP0 delegate to review it.
4. Incorporate any comments you recieve during review into your branch's materials.
5. After your reviewer has approved your PR, merge your branch into ``main``.

All delegates will have write access and so it is possible to commit changes directly to ``main``, but this is discouraged.

### Best Practices

Please always:
- document your code for non-experts
- provide links to background information
- clear notebook outputs before committing changes

All tutorials should have a header containing:
 - the author's name
 - the date the tutorial was last tested
 - the goals of the notebook

See the example directory for guidance on formatting notebooks and markdown files.
