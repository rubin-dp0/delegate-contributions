# This is a cheat sheet of GitHub commands for DP0 delegates using this repository.
# This cheat sheet was initially prepared by Doug Tucker for the Stack Cub members.  
# The following will be most useful to people who are new to git and command lines.

# Below, "your_name" = your GitHub username.
# "This repository" is "delegate-contributions-dp01".
# "This GitHub Org" is "rubin-dp0".

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Get started - make a local copy of this repo in your home directory.
# In the Notebook Aspect of the Rubin Science Platform (JupyterLab), launch a terminal.

# First, check your present working directory:
pwd

# This should return /home/your_name

# Now list the contents of your present working directory:
ls

# You will see that you have a notebooks directory. Go into it:
cd notebooks

# You will see that two directories already exist: system_test and tutorial-notebooks
# The tutorial-notebooks directory will match the repository with the same name in this GitHub Org.

# Clone this repository, delegate-contributions-dp01, into your notebooks directory:
git clone https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp01.git

# Now go into it:
cd delegate-contributions-dp01

# List the contents:
ls

# This list will match what you see in https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp01
# Including this CheatSheet.txt file.

# Here are some useful "git" commands:
git status       # returns current branch, changed files; use this frequently
git branch -a    # list all branches of this repo
git remote -v    # list the remotes for this repo

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Prepare to work - make yourself a branch and switch to it

# By default, right after a "git clone", you will be in the "main" branch.

# Create a new branch to use for your own work, and switch to that branch in one command.
# By convention, we name user branches "u/your_name":
git checkout -b u/your_name

# Confirm that you are working in your new branch
git branch
git status

# Alternatively, you could create a new branch *without* switching to it:
git branch u/your_name

# To switch to any existing branch at any time:
git checkout u/your_name

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Work in your branch - edit files and notebooks or create new ones
 
# If editing/creating a notebook:
#  1. make your changes until you are 'done'
#  2. from menu bar select Kernel --> Restart and Run All Cells
#  3. fix errors until the whole notebook executes
#  4. from menu bar select Kernel --> Restart and Clear All Cells
#  5. from menu bar select File --> Save Notebook 

# The final save should be a cleared notebook with no executed cells.

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Commit changes to your local branch
# This can be done periodically as you work

# Check which files have been changed
git status

# All of the changed files must be added in order to commit
# Add files one at a time
git add <filename>

# Check that all changed files have been added
git status

# Commit your changes to the local branch
git commit -m "Leave a short comment within quotes"

-----------------------------------------------------------
# Push your commits to your branch of the remote repository
# This can be done periodically, or only when you're "finished"

git push origin u/your_name

# You might be asked for your password at this point.
# You can avoid having to do this all the time by setting up your git credentials.
# See the bottom part of the README.md file for this GitHub Org for instructions.


-----------------------------------------------------------
# Merge your branch with main to share your work with everyone

# Submit a "pull" request via the webpage

# Start here: https://github.com/rubin-dp0/delegate-contributions-dp01/pulls
# Click on green "New pull request" button.
# Choose "main" and then "u/your_name".
# The arrow should point FROM "u/your-name" TO "main".

# This will alert others in DP0 that your changes
# are ready for a Code Review (we anticipate this would 
# be performed by another DP0 delegate).  It is good to assign at
# least one possible reviewer explicitly and mention them
# explicitly by their GitHub name in the description of the "pull" request.
# There may be some iteration with the Code Reviewer 
# you will be able to follow the discussion via e-mail.

# Once the Code Reviewer(s) are satisfied, they will
# will approve the changes and you will get an e-mail
# indicating the "pull" request has been approved.

# After getting e-mail saying the "pull" request has been approved, perform a "merge".
#
#  If the branch has no conflicts with the master branch on GitHub, you might be able to
#  just click on the Big Green "Merge pull request" Button at the bottom of this particular
#  "pull" request's webpage.  
#
#  If you are merging the pull request from the Git Web page, you might still want/need to do the
#
git branch -d your_name" 
# (which deletes the local version of your_name), and 
# 
git push origin --delete your_name
# (which deletes the remote version of your_name on github)
#   
# Alternatively, you can do the same using the step-by-step command-line version, using commands shown below:  
#
git checkout master     # Switch from your_name back to master branch (locally)
git pull origin master  # Make sure local master branch is up-to-date with remote origin master branch on github
git branch --merged     # Check to see if your_name has been merged locally
git merge your_name      # Merge pyour_name with local master branch
git branch --merged     # Verify the merge worked
git push origin master  # Push local master back to remote origin master on github
git branch -d your_name  # Delete local version of your_name
git push origin --delete your_name  # Delete remote version of your_name on github
git branch -a           # Verify that the local and remote versions of your_name have been deleted
# (Note:  there may be some redundancy here.  I was following the workflow described in
#         the youtube video listed under "General git tutorial stuff" in the "Other useful
#         git commands" section below.)
#
#
# Start with a new branch to address other issues:
git status              # Always good to check...
# Note:  ideally, the issue number should be part of the name of a new branch:
git checkout -b your_name   # Create a new branch and move to it...
git branch              # Confirm you are now working on that branch
# ... and so on...



-----------------------------------------------------------
Other useful git commands:

git --version
# Two commands below might be necessary to execute the command "git push origin your_name" (you would have seen an error message) 
git config --global user.email "your_name@yourinstitution.com"  # create/update your e-mail address in the local git configuration
git config --global user.name "your_name"   # create/update your username in the local git configuration
git config --list
git config --help
git help config
git log
git diff
